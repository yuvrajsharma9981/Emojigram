<b>It Works By </b>
<br/>--  Emojigram is a text game where users are asked to guess a common
phrase or sentence based off of a series of emoji's, their guess is
compared to the database value stored and if matched the user recieves
feedback that they were correct.

<br/>
<b>In The Future We'd Like To Add </b>
<br/>--  Better natural guess
<br/>--  Counter of correct input
<br/>--  Auto delete unguessed (after time)
<br/>----  Filter by most guessed or newest
<br/>--  Constrain user input (nonEmoji input)
<br/>--  Implement emoji keyboard
<br/>--  Lazy loading
